This repository shows the work I presented at the 41st EARSeL Sumposium.

The jupyter notebook with the workflow is called EARSeL_Nice.ipynb

The data I used to create labels is obtained from the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest. They can be downloaded from this website: https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/data-fusion-contest-2022-dfc2022#files
More information on the data fusion contest: https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/2022-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest/

The code started from the work by Tassi, A. and Vizzari, M. You can find their paper here: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/22/3776

My poster will (upon review) be presented at Geo For Good. You can see it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FLgNKJnxJEUCdXjH4T4flQgdsl-871PmXkrJ1CDhgqQ/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-hUdA-un_jGq8UlVZwyk6UA
